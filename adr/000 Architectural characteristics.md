Architectural characteristics priority

The information is quite limited, but we can enable our imagination and find the most important architectural characteristics

What we can consider:
`At this time, the functionality of the program is quite limited but this might change in the future.` implies that extensibility and maintainability should be in priority
Also, i heard that it is better to create the app in TDD style (i absolutely agree), therefore Testability has a high priority

*Most Important*
 - Testability
 - Maintainability
 - Extensibility

It means that characteristics such as Performance, Resource tolerance will not be considered as a high priority and 
during development we will not take a look on these guys.
